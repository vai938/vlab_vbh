                    <p class="desc">Redox stands for Reduction - Oxidation <br>
                        Redox titrations involve the titration of an oxidizing agent (or oxidant) with a
                        reducing agent (or reductant) or vice versa. There must be a sufficiently large
                        difference between the oxidizing and reducing capabilities of theses agents for the
                        reaction to undergo completion with a sharp end point. <br>
                        Oxidation process involves loss of electrons while reduction process involves gain
                        of electrons. <br>
                        Thus an oxidizing agent is one which accepts electrons while a reducing agent is
                        one which loses the electrons. <br>
                        An oxidizing agent oxidizes the other substance by stripping off electrons from it.
                        A reducing agent reduces the other substance by donating electrons to it.
                        Oxidation and reduction reactions always occur simultaneously. One can not take
                        place in isolation from the other. During a redox reaction the oxidizing agent itself
                        undergoes reduction while the reducing agent undergoes its oxidation. <br>

                            <p class="desc">It is important to note that for many oxidants the pH of the medium is
                                of great importance and hence their oxidizing strength may vary depending on the
                                medium in which its reaction is studied. For example potassium permanganate is
                                oxidizing agent in all three mediums, acid, alkaline and neutral. However it is
                                strongest in acidic medium.</p>

                                indicator itself should be redox active i.e., capable of undergoing a reversible
                                oxidation or reduction process. The oxidized and reduced form of the indicator
                                should have a contrast difference in the colours. <br>

                            Potassium dichromate is also a very strong oxidizing agent <pre>(E<sup>0</sup><sub>red</sub>=+1.33V)</pre> However
                            it is not as strong oxidizing agent as permanganate is <pre>(E<sup>0</sup><sub>red</sub>=+1.51V).</pre> Still it is widely
                            used in redox titrations because of several advantages over permanganate. Unlike
                            potassium permanganate, potassium dichromate is available in high purity and is
                            highly stable up to its melting point. Its aqueous solutions are not attacked by
                            oxidisable impurities like rubber or any other organic matter and thus composition
                            of aqueous solution does not change on keeping. The aqueous solutions are quite
                            stable towards light. It is thus an excellent primary standard and its standard
                            solutions can be prepared by direct weighing of an amount of it and dissolving in a
                            known volume of distilled water.

                            <p class="desc">The neutral aqueous solution of Potassium dichromate is 1:1 equilibrium
                                mixture of
                                dichromate and chromate, a consequence of hydrolysis of dichromate ions. <br>
                                <img src="images/ch4.png" width="50%" height="30%" alt=""> <br>
                                Chromate ions are weaker oxidizing agent than dichromate. Thus oxidizing strength
                                of dichromate is reduced in neutral solution. The above hydrolysis reaction however
                                can be reversed by adding acid to the solution and this explains the necessity of
                                acidic medium for the reaction. <br> <br>
                                Also the reduction reaction of dichromate can be represented as: <br>
                                <img src="images/ch5.png" width="50%" height="30%" alt=""> <br>
                                This reaction clearly shows the involvement of <pre>H<sup>+</sup> in the reduction half reaction.</pre> <br>
                                The medium is generally acidified with dil. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Unlike
                                permanganate case, cold
                                HCl can be used here for acidifying the reaction mixture provided the acid
                                concentration does not increase beyond 1-2 M. <br>
                                Though the dichromate solutions are intensely orange coloured solutions and a
                                single drop of it imparts yellow colour to a colourless solution, it can&#39;t be used as a
                                self indicator like KMnO<sub>4</sub>. This is because its reduction product
                                (Cr3<sup>+</sup>) is green which
                                hinders the visual detection of end point by observing dichromate colour. Thus an
                                indicator is must required in this titration. The indicator should be redox active and
                                must be properly chosen keeping in mind the electrode potential values of the
                                reducing agent being titrated with dichromate. Suitable indicators for dichromate
                                titrations are Diphenylamine (specifically sodium diphenylamine

                                sulphonate)(0.2%aq. Soln) in presence of orthophosphoric acid, and N-
                                phenylanthranilic acid (0.1% soln. in 0.005 M NaOH).

                            Mohr&#39;s salt is a primary standard and therefore its standard solution can be easily

                            preparing standard solution of Mohr&#39;s salt it is necessary to add about 1 ml of dil.
                            H2SO4 to the measuring flask. Simple Ferrous sulphate is not a primary standard and
                            hence can never be used for preparing the standard solution. The solid sample of
                            ferrous sulphate contains a high percentage of ferric ions produced by aerial
                            oxidation of the ferrous ions. Thus composition is not accurately known. <br>
                            The reaction between Potassium dichromate and Mohr&#39;s salt can be represented as: <br>
                            <img src="images/ch7.png" width="50%" height="30%" alt=""> <br>
                            The end point of the titration as indicated earlier has to be defined with the help of
                            an indicator.
                            Diphenylamine is one such indicator (internal indicator as it is added to the reaction
                            mixture). The end point is marked with an intense blue violet colouration. The
                            reduction potential value of this system is E<sup>0</sup><sub>red</sub> = +0.76V which is
                            very near to that of
                            ferrous- ferric system (E<sup>0</sup><sub>red</sub> = + 0.77V). Thus phosphoric acid is
                            required in this
                            titration as it reacts with the product ( yellow ) Fe3<sup>+</sup> ion to form the complex
                            ion
                            [Fe(HPO<sub>4</sub>)]<sup>+</sup>

                            , thus lowering the formal potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) system thereby

                            increasing its reducing power. Thus the end point is sharper.
                            <br>
                            The diphenyl amine (I) undergoes oxidation first into a colourless diphenylbenzidine
                            (II) which is the real indicator and is reversibly further oxidized to diphenylbenzidine
                            violet (III).
                            The titrations done here are double titrations. This means in the first titration
                            K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is standardized by titrating with a standard solution of Mohr&#39;s salt and in the
                            second titration this standardized K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is titrated against a given oxalate ion
                            solution of unknown strength.

                                demonstrated in lab session) This is weight of empty weighing bottle (w1).
                                Now put an approximate quantity of Mohr&#39;s salt to be weighed in the weighing
                                bottle. Weigh again. In case the added amount is too much than required , take out
                                some with the help of a clean spatula and weigh the weighing bottle. In case the
                                added amount is less than required, add some more into the weighing bottle. (Never
                                add compound to the weighing bottle, when it is still placed on the pan of the

                                keep the weighing bottle back on the pan of weighing balance. Note down the
                                weight as weight of weighing bottle after transference of compound (w3). The
                                difference of (w3) and (w2) gives the amount of compound actually transferred to the
